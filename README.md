### 📚Introduction
---
If business processes do not handle information securely the consequence can be
dire. There is currently no modelling language or appropriate methods to effectively
analyze possible security issues of information used in processes.
To solve the aforementioned problem we have identified some goals to be accomplished:
1)Create a modeling language to describe information and its use within
processes;
2)Define algorithms to analyze security properties in business processes;
3)Implement the algorithms inside a software and test them with use cases.
